# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description
The original code attempts to find a user based on an ID passed in the URL.  It fails to handle cases where:

1.  The ID is not a valid number.
2.  No user with the given ID exists.

These failures lead to unexpected errors and potentially expose vulnerabilities.

## Solution
The improved version (`bugSolution.js`) incorporates error handling to gracefully manage invalid IDs and non-existent users, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (400 and 404 respectively).
